//! Running work on a [`ComputeTarget`].
//!
//! Library code takes a [`Client`] (cubecl 0.11 resolves the runtime when the client is made, not
//! through a generic); the CLI, Python bindings and the app pick a target once and get its client,
//! or run a [`ComputeTask`] on it.
//!
//! **Devices are shut down at exit.** CubeCL runs each device on a runner thread that nothing joins,
//! so the device is never destroyed and the GPU driver's own worker threads (NVIDIA's shader
//! compiler) were still running while the process exited: an intermittent crash or hang after all
//! the work was done (SIGSEGV in `libnvidia-glvkspirv`, "corrupted double-linked list" in
//! `libnvidia-gpucomp`, with the main thread inside `exit()`). Every device a client is made for is
//! recorded, and an exit handler, registered after each device is opened (so it runs before the
//! handlers of the libraries and layers loaded until then), shuts them down: [`shutdown_devices`].
